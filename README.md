A comparison between C and Go implementations of a Traffic Control System Simulator

Abstract—This paper presents a comparison between C and Go implementations of a Traffic Control System Simulator. The analysis focuses on comparing both languages from a time efficiency standpoint and paradigm standpoint according to Van Roy’s taxonomy of programming languages. Also, implementation complexity, multi-threading capabilities, techniques, and technical constraints of both languages are shown. A quantitative analysis of the simulation runs is used to clarify the obtained results, which show that Go is a usable, flexible, and well-performing language for most applications, having a good trade-off between productivity and efficiency, being then a choice over C for most cases. C is still opted as a reliable language for low-level and strict-timing programming.
